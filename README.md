# RelaxaSearch

RelaxaSearch aims to be a full text search engine and lightweight replacemenet for ElasticSearch, built on top of Bleve using Go.

RelaxaSearch derives from portuguese word "Relaxa", which basically means be calm. Only those who already tried to setup ElasticSearch, or OpenSearch knows how stressfull setting them up it can be sometimes.

On other hands, Relax Search tries to be simplest and easiest solution for a full text search engine.

## Installation



## Usage
You can just run the binary on any directory you want. Please note that relaxasearch will look up for a directory called `relaxasearchData`. This diretory **should be on the same directory that you are running relaxasearch**. It will be responsable for storing the index data. If you hadn't set it up, relaxasearch will throw an error on terminal.
